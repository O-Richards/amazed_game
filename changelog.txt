    * Added a applyToPlayer method to useable items that is called when an
    item is picked up by a player. This is used for potions 
    * Changed enemies so the tile asks them where they want to move, then the
    tile asks the level to move them
    *

    * TODO: Fix boulders, need a field on tiles for "passive mobile entities"
    * TODO: Fix win conditions. In Level.addItem() need to stop hard coding WinType.TREASURE. At the moment it wont win untill all items are picked up
    * TODO: Swith tile -> need to fix boulder win condition and remove SwitchTile.updateWinCondition and from Tile.updateWinCondition()

    * The pits may fail when using the invincibility potion. This needs to be
    tested (as it calls kill, but it will block it from 'killing' them)
    * Refactored Tiles so all it holds is mobile entities. This created a bit
    of complicated logic, but at least there is no code duplication
    * Got player moving again, picking up objects, being killed by enemies,
    doors working, pits (mostly) working
    * TODO: Enemies are not moving properly for some reason right now
